# Firebase Authentication & Firestore Issues - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary
You're experiencing:
1. OAuth domain authorization errors
2. Firestore connection 400 Bad Request errors  
3. Registration hanging on the page (but users are created)
4. Login works fine

## Solutions

### 1. Fix OAuth Domain Authorization (CRITICAL)

**Go to Firebase Console immediately:**
1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `unilocator-368db`
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Authorized domains** tab
4. Add these domains:
   - `10.250.43.156` (your current IP)
   - `localhost` (for local development)
   - `127.0.0.1` (alternative localhost)
   - `192.168.1.x` (if you use other local IPs)

### 2. Update Firestore Security Rules (CRITICAL)

**Go to Firebase Console:**
1. Navigate to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
2. Replace the current rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow any authenticated user to read/write (for development)
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

**Click "Publish" to save the rules.**

### 3. Test Your Setup

After making the above changes:

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
2. **Restart your Flask server:**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
3. **Try registration again**

### 4. Production Security Rules (After testing works)

Once everything works, replace the permissive rules with secure ones:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own profile
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Device management
    match /devices/{deviceId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.ownerId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Other collections as needed...
  }
}
```

## Why These Errors Occurred

1. **OAuth Domain Error**: Firebase blocks authentication from unauthorized domains for security
2. **Firestore 400 Errors**: Your security rules were likely too restrictive, blocking writes during user registration
3. **Hanging Registration**: The frontend couldn't complete the Firestore write, so it never got a success response

## Expected Result After Fix

- No more OAuth domain errors in console
- No more Firestore 400 errors
- Registration completes successfully and redirects to dashboard
- Login continues to work normally

## Debugging Tips

If issues persist:

1. **Check browser console** for detailed error messages
2. **Check Flask logs** for backend errors
3. **Verify Firebase Console** shows new users being created
4. **Test with different browsers** to rule out cache issues

## Security Notes

- The current setup uses permissive Firestore rules for development
- In production, implement specific rules for each collection
- Consider adding rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Monitor Firebase usage in the console to watch for abuse
